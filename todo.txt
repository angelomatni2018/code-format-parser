Structure:
	Regex parse rules to identify rules and their frequency
	Frequency to determine the overarching format preferences
	Regex to match and replace text to follow format

Apply structure to tab/space indentation
	Regex over line by line for this 
	Later on, account for chain of regexes for across-line matching

   Unlike other lines, this starts with spaces.
